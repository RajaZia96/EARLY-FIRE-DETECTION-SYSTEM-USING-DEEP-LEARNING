# EARLY-FIRE-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
Developed a fire detection system using EfficientNet_b1 and LSTM to analyze CCTV video frames. Combined spatial and temporal features for accurate fire/smoke recognition. Applied transfer learning, frame-level annotations, and data augmentation for real-time surveillance and early fire detection.
